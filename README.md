# MyFlix - A Mini Netflix Clone

MyFlix is a simple web application inspired by Netflix, where users can browse movies, filter them by category, save their favorite movies, and switch between light and dark modes. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it stores favorites locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Movie Categories**: Easily filter movies by categories such as Action, Comedy, Horror, and TV Shows.
- **Favorites System**: Click the heart icon to save movies to your favorites, which are stored locally in the browser.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes with a simple button click.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, making it look great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations, including light/dark mode transitions.
- **JavaScript**: To handle dynamic behaviors such as movie filtering, adding favorites, and toggling themes.
- **Local Storage**: To store favorite movies locally in the browser without the need for a backend.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:  
   You can either clone the repository or download the ZIP file of the project.
   
2. **Open `index.html`**:  
   Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project. No server or backend is required as it runs entirely in the browser.

3. **Explore the Features**:  
   - Use the category buttons to filter movies by Action, Comedy, Horror, or TV Shows.
   - Click the heart button next to a movie to add it to your favorites. These are saved in your browserâ€™s local storage.
   - Toggle between Light and Dark mode by clicking the theme switch button.
